- Pink button   : Start measure
- Yellow button :  Recovery (If PHOT can't come back)

## Mechanism

![](assets/[5]Laserrangefinder-9b4d5.png)

SPRK heat METL consistently. And PHOT speed is also consistent too. When pink button activated, then PCLN generates PHOT and cool them by PSCN-SPRK by BTRY and slow down them for accuracy. So while PHOT is in outside, SPRK starts heating METL. Therefore METL temperature increases in proportion to the time during PHOT is in outside.
